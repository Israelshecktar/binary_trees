## Project Description

The Binary Trees Project is designed as an in-depth study of binary tree structures, their properties, and associated algorithms. It aims to provide a hands-on experience in the creation, traversal, and management of binary trees, with particular attention to memory management, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards.

## Features

- **Node Creation:** Functions to create new nodes in a binary tree.
- **Insertion Operations:** Ability to insert nodes as left or right children.
- **Deletion Mechanism:** Functionality to delete an entire binary tree to prevent memory leaks.
- **BST Implementation:** Methods to work with the specialized case of binary search trees.
- **Compliance:** All code complies with the Betty coding style for C programming.

## Installation

The code is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the following GCC flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`. To start using or contributing to this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory.
3. Compile the code files using the provided Makefile or GCC commands.

## Usage

The project includes various functions that can be used to interact with binary tree data structures. Example usage is as follows:
